# DataSynthesis Data Tier APIs
DataSynthesis Data Tier APIs are intended to be a place where several different languages of APIs are developed
to access the DataSynthesis data model.

| Type|Usage/Implementation |
| -------------|----------|
|[Quarkus DataTier APIs](https://github.com/Project-Herophilus/DataSynthesis/tree/main/DataTier-APIs/Quarkus-APIs)|Quarkus based APIs to access datatier.|
|[Express DataTier APIs](https://github.com/Project-Herophilus/DataSynthesis/tree/main/DataTier-APIs/Express-APIs)|Javascript Express based APIs to access datatier.|

# Testing APIs
To help enable resources to leverage the APIs we have pre-built and are continuing to enhance a set of PostMan APIs.
The intent is to that anyone can see how the APIs can be leveraged simply and directly.
