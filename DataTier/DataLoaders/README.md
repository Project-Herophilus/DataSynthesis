# DataSynthesis Loading Seeded Data
The easiest thing we could have done is make this a complete SaaS based offering. We are cognizant of the potential for
partners to build out potential services offering down the road. We also want to ensure that organizations can
have control of the data.

# Data Loading Types
There are two options for data loading, Insert Scripts and Jupyter Notebooks. Our intent is to get to
using Juptyer notebooks only eventually.
